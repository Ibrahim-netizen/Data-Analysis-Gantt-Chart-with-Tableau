# Data-Analysis-Gantt-Chart-with-Tableau
A Gantt chart is a project management tool used to display the various stages of a task/event. It shows the time schedule of tasks to be executed and aids in keeping track of the task progress. Using Tableau, a business intelligence tool for easy data visualization, I designed a Gantt chart demonstrating the various steps I observe when performing data analysis on various projects within a 4-week timeframe with a reference line showing the current date.  

The first stage involves understanding the research problem I intend to tackle and eventually solve which inform my project end-goal and objectives to meet in achieving the aim of my project. An extensive review of scholarly works already performed in the field of my selected research project is performed to advise on the type of machine learning (ML) algorithm to incorporate for this project.  Another important tool that advise my choice of ML algorithm is the acquisition and structure of the data to be integrated into the project before designing and implementing my selected ML algorithm. Finally, a test prediction is performed and various performance metrics are applied to evaluate the accuracy level of the designed model.
